## The Dashboard of the Future?



NeXGeN is a WIP dashboard for the original XBOX which has support for a 2D & 3D skinning engine. It should be capable of replicating the stock dash look & feel as well as allowing users to render & create their own 3D models, etc.

This dash is not a mod, but rather it is being written from the ground up by a small team of dedicated homebrew scene members. It is currently in it's early alpha phase, unreleased to the public at this time.

HoRnEyDvL has stated that they do plan to release this as open source in the future.

Current photos and communication from the team indicates they have a functioning 3D engine, 2D engine, multiple models made, support for animated sprites, and multiple XBOX Dash lookalike skins functioning, along with indications that there will be RSS feed support. 

The team is looking to bring on more contributors, especially if you are knowledgeable about C++, 3D Modeling, and engine coding.
